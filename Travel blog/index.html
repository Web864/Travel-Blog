                Hiran Minar, also “The Deer Tower,” lies in Sheikhupura city, Punjab province. It is one of the best historical places in Pakistan. Mughal Emperor Jahangir built it in the 17th century in his pet deer memory named ‘Mansraj. ‘It is a 100 feet tall minaret and was a hunting reserve for the use of Mughal royals. Later, Jahangir’s son Shah Jahan built a square water tank with an octagonal pavilion in its centre.

                Moreover, a causeway with its gateway connects the pavilion with the mainland and a 100-foot-high minaret. A forest with a wild Babul tree (kikar tree) in abundance surrounds the Hiran Minar. Also, among those trees, Hiran Minar looks like a priceless gem drifting on an island of water surrounded by land. The ambience is marvellous and worth saving for future generations, simply because it will never be rebuilt.
                <br>
                Also, Hiran Minar is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

            <p>People of Pakistan is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and predominantly a Muslim society. Ninety-seven per cent of the140 million people in Pakistan are Muslims.

                People of Pakistan Race as such plays little part in defining regional or group identity in Pakistan, and no ideal racial type is accepted by all Pakistanis. However, ethno-lingual processes over the centuries have helped developed nationalities and ethno-lingual groups who have a deep sense of identity, psychological make-up, commonality of language and area and belonging to certain regions of Pakistan. People of Pakistan population is a complex mixture of indigenous peoples, many racial types having been introduced by successive waves of migrations from the northwest, as well as by internal migrations across the subcontinent of India. Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Pathans (Pashtuns), and Mughals came from the northwest and spread across the Indo-Gangetic Plain, while the Arabs conquered Sindh. All left their mark on the population and culture of the land. During the long period of Muslim rule, immigrants from the Middle East were brought in and installed as members of the ruling oligarchy. It became prestigious to claim descent from them, and many members of the landed gentry and of upper-class families are either actually or putatively descended from such immigrants.</p>
